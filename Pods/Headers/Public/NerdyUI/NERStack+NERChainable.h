/**
 * Horizontal Stack with items.
 * Each item is stack horizontally, from left to right with optional spacing.
 
 * There are two way to specify fix spacing:
    1) Use NSNumber for individual spacing between two items.
    2) Use .gap for spacing between all subviews.
   If set both, the NSNumber approach take precedence.
 
 * There is also a NERSpring object that will take as mush space if available. Just like a spring.
 
 * By embed NERStack into another stack, you are able to create a much more complicated UI.
 
 * Usages:
    HStack(view1, @5, view2, @10, view3)
    Hstack(view1, view2, view3).gap(5)
